/*SRP- The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.So, we need to
design the software in a way where everything in a class should be related to a single responsibility.That does not mean your class should contain
only one method.You can have multiple methods if they are related to a single responsibility or functionality.*/
